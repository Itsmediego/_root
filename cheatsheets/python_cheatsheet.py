	to have to keep typing math.sqrt().

	It's possible to import only certain variables or functions from a given module.
	Pulling in just a single function from a module is called a function import, and
	it's done with the from keyword:
	"""

	#[Don't use Universal Imports]

	'''
	Here Be Dragons

	Universal imports may look great on the surface, but they're not a good idea for one very
	important reason:
	they fill your program with a ton of variable and function names without the safety of
	those names still being associated with the module(s) they came from.

	If you have a function of your very own named sqrt and you import math, your function
	is safe: there is your sqrt and there is math.sqrt. If you do from math import *, however,
	you have a problem: namely, two different functions with the exact same name.

	Even if your own definitions don't directly conflict with names from imported modules, if
	you import * from several modules at once, you won't be able to figure out which
	variable or function came from where.

	For these reasons, it's best to stick with either import module and type module.name
	or just import specific variables and functions from various modules as needed.

		    range(start, stop, step)

		In all cases, the range() function returns a list of numbers from start up to
		(but not including) stop. Each item increases by step.

		If omitted, start defaults to zero and step defaults to one.

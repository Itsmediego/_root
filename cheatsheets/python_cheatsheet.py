#[Function Imports]

	"""
	Nice work! Now Python knows how to take the square root of a number.

	However, we only really needed the sqrt function, and it can be frustrating
	to have to keep typing math.sqrt().

	It's possible to import only certain variables or functions from a given module.
	Pulling in just a single function from a module is called a function import, and
	it's done with the from keyword:
	"""

	from module import function

	"""
	Now you can just type sqrt() to get the square root of a numberâ€”no more math.sqrt()!

	#[List all functions in a module]

	everything = dir(math) # Sets everything to a list of things from math
	print everything       # Prints 'em all!

	#[Universal Import]

	'''
	What if we still want all of the variables and functions in a module but don't want to
	have to constantly type math.?

	Universal import can handle this for you. The syntax for this is:
	'''

	from module import *

	Ex:

	from math import *
	print sqrt(25)

	#[Don't use Universal Imports]

	'''
	Here Be Dragons

	Universal imports may look great on the surface, but they're not a good idea for one very important reason:
	they fill your program with a ton of variable and function names without the safety of those names still
	being associated with the module(s) they came from.

	If you have a function of your very own named sqrt and you import math, your function is safe: there is
	your sqrt and there is math.sqrt. If you do from math import *, however, you have a problem: namely,
	two different functions with the exact same name.

	Even if your own definitions don't directly conflict with names from imported modules, if you import *
	from several modules at once, you won't be able to figure out which variable or function came from where.

	For these reasons, it's best to stick with either import module and type module.name or just import
	specific variables and functions from various modules as needed.

	#[List Slicing]

#[Dictionary]

	'''
	A dictionary is similar to a list, but you access values by looking up a key instead
	of an index. A key can be any string or number. Dictionaries are enclosed in
	curly braces, like so:
	'''

	d = {'key1' : 1, 'key2' : 2, 'key3' : 3}

	'''
	This is a dictionary called d with three key-value pairs. The key 'key1' points to the
	value 1, 'key2' to 2, and so on.

	Dictionaries are great for things like phone books (pairing a name with a phone number),
	login pages (pairing an e-mail address with a username), and more!
	'''

	# Assigning a dictionary with three key-value pairs to residents:

		residents = {'Puffin' : 104, 'Sloth' : 105, 'Burmese Python' : 106}

		print residents['Puffin'] # Prints Puffin's room number

		# Your code here!
		print residents['Sloth']
		print residents['Burmese Python']

	#[Adding New entries]

		'''
		An empty pair of curly braces {} is an empty dictionary, just like an empty pair of []
		is an empty list.
		'''

		menu = {} # Empty dictionary
		menu['Chicken Alfredo'] = 14.50 # Adding new key-value pair
		print menu['Chicken Alfredo']

		# Your code here: Add some dish-price pairs to menu!
		menu['Letuce Sandwich'] = 3.50
		menu['Mango Juice'] = 12.70
		menu['Sweet Corn + Chat Masala'] = 1.80

		print "There are " + str(len(menu)) + " items on the menu."
		print menu

	#[Add & Delete]

		'''
		Because dictionaries are mutable, they can be changed in many ways. Items can be removed
		from a dictionary with the del command:
		'''

		del dict_name[key_name]

		'''
		will remove the key key_name and its associated value from the dictionary.

		A new value can be associated with a key by assigning a value to the key, like so:
		'''

		dict_name[key] = new_value

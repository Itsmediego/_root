RPi <--LAN--> Desktop <--> Internet

On Windows:
	1. LAN settings detects 2 connections
	2. Go to the main connection's settings (one that's connected to the internet)
	3. Properties -> Sharing 
		Check - Allow sharing network users to connect ....
		Uncheck - Allow ... to control or disable the shared internet connection
	
	4. Now in the network & sharing center, 2 connections will become 1 

On RPi (Jessie):
	1. ifconfig - IP will have changed
		Ex: 169.254.202.18 would've become 192.168.137.218
		
To login to RPi without knowing it's IP address ?
	On Windows : 
		open cmd, run 'arp -a', will list all network interfaces' IP addressess.
